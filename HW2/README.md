## Homework #1

**General**

All code is in the Jupyter Notebook - *main.ipynb*.

Using common libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- PIL
- altair (not used)
- matplotlib


**Data processing:**

Before loading the .csv file as pandas DataFrame, I deleted the first line of the .csv file (title I guess), and saved it as *data.csv*.
Then, I dropped unnecessary columns and found the average temperature for each year. I did not converted the year value to the datetime, although it could have opened more possibilities with data aggregation and further visualization, it was not needed. 

**Visualization:**

I used Matplotlib to replicate the plot.

Result:
